    <p>I really love raccoons. Although they are seen as varmits by many, I personally think that they are cute and quirky.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use their paws to pick up food to eat</li>
        <li>They act similar to cats</li>
        <li>Fluffy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unless they have rabies, I believe that most raccoons are harmless and should not be treated as pests.</p>
